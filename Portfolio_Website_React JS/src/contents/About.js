            <p>I have always been interested in computers and technology so going into IT fields was an easy choice. 
            I am currently pursuing my Web Development Associate Degree at
            Wake Technical College in NC and will graduate in December 2020.  
            Web development is my main center of interest but I also express interest in Web Design and Graphic Design.
            Being able to grasp the ideas behind Front and Back End Development 
            has given me a wider perspective about the field and made me a better coder and a better learner in general.
